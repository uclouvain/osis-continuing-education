# OSIS Continuing Education

OSIS Continuing Education is a web application to manage the continuing education programmes
intended for people active in the working world and pursuing the goal of progressing
by acquiring knowledge or changing professions.

This application is part of [OSIS](osis), an umbrella project to manage the 
core business of higher education institutions. It is a Django application that
only works when installed together with OSIS. It cannot run separately because
it depends on the applications [base](base), [reference](reference) and 
[osis-common](osis-common).
